In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with array keys that are not explicitly defined.  Consider this example:

```php
$myArray = [];
$myArray["someKey"] = "someValue";
echo $myArray["anotherKey"];
```

PHP will not throw an error if you try to access a non-existent key ("anotherKey" in this case). Instead, it will implicitly return `null` which can lead to unexpected behavior and difficult to track bugs, particularly if the value is subsequently used in calculations or other operations without proper null checks.

The problem is exacerbated when working with functions that expect an array with a specific structure, because null values can easily break assumptions about data consistency and cause unexpected errors down the line. For instance, functions that loop over arrays may attempt to process a null value inappropriately or generate unexpected outputs in calculations or string manipulations.
