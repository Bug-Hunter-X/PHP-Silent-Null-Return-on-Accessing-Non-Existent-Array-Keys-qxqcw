To avoid the silent null return, always explicitly check if a key exists before accessing it.  PHP's `isset()` function is ideal for this:

```php
$myArray = [];
$myArray["someKey"] = "someValue";

if (isset($myArray["anotherKey"])) {
  echo $myArray["anotherKey"];
} else {
  echo "Key 'anotherKey' does not exist."; // Handle the missing key gracefully
}
```

Alternatively, you can use the null coalescing operator (`??`) to provide a default value if the key is not found:

```php
$myArray = [];
$myArray["someKey"] = "someValue";

$value = $myArray["anotherKey"] ?? "Default Value";
echo $value; // Outputs "Default Value"
```

By incorporating these checks, your code becomes significantly more robust and less prone to unexpected errors caused by implicitly returned null values.
